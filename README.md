### Company Overview
Tech Innovators Inc., established in 2015, is a rapidly growing technology and consulting firm headquartered in New York.

**Key Milestones:**
- **2017**: Expanded service offerings to include cloud consulting, significantly increasing the client base.
- **2019**: Achieved 40% year-over-year revenue growth through technology expertise and successful digital transformation projects.
- **2021**: Invested heavily in employee development programs and remote work infrastructure to enhance satisfaction and productivity.

---

### Business Problem
The HR department faces two major interrelated challenges:

1. **Limited Visibility and Real-Time Performance Evaluation**
   - Quarterly Performance Ratings System exists but lacks real-time insights.
   - Unable to tailor training and interventions for high-performing or struggling employees in a timely manner.
   - Attendance data is collected but not leveraged for proactive interventions.

2. **Inefficient Employee Benefit Programs**
   - Limited insight into which benefits employees use most and their ROI.
   - Benefits offered: Health Insurance, Wellness Programs, Gym Membership, Paid Time-Off.
   - Resulting in escalating costs, underutilized programs, and inefficient resource allocation.
  
**Impact:**
- Operational inefficiency & delayed interventions
- Increased HR costs due to overspending on low-usage benefits
- Employee dissatisfaction, disengagement, and potential higher turnover

---

### Key Insights: Employee Overview
- Total of **244 employees** across 4 locations (New York: 27.9%, San Francisco: 22.1%)
- Largest department: **IT** | Smallest: **HR**
- 7 departments, 46 roles (14 Entry-Level, 23 Mid-Level, 9 Senior-Level)
- Average employee age: **33–41 years**
- Tenure range: **1 to 10 years**
- Some employees show attendance as low as **40%**
- Strong positive correlation between **high attendance and high performance scores**

---

### Employee Performance Report A Summary
- Average Quarterly Performance Rating: **3.17** (+18.7% from previous quarter)
- Average Engagement Score: **2.97** (relatively low)
- Average Performance Score: **71.02**
- Training completion rate: **51.2%**
- Employees who completed training generally show higher performance (especially Females: 72.86 vs. 69.00 without training)
- Clear upward trend: Rating 1 = 50.10 → Rating 5 = **86.6**
- Top-performing departments: **Marketing (74.55)**, IT (73), Consulting (71.56)
- Lowest: Finance (66.70), HR (67.65)
- Highest location performance: **Austin (76.13)** | Lowest: San Francisco (68.71)

---

### Results and Findings
**Performance & Training:**
- Training completion positively impacts performance in most cases, but some high performers succeed without formal training.
- Unusual finding: Employees without training sometimes improved more than those with training — suggesting need to review training quality/relevance.

**Attendance:**
- Overall average attendance: **90.59%** (strong), but drops slightly with seniority (Senior-level: 89.34%)

**Benefits Utilization & Satisfaction:**
- Average benefit utilization frequency: **1.99** (very low → underutilization)
- Most enrolled: **Health Insurance** → Wellness Program (193) → Gym (138) → **PTO only 9 employees**
- Most frequently used: **Gym Membership (3.49)** | Least: Paid Time-Off
- Highest satisfaction: Remote workers (3.27) & Finance department (despite lower performance)
- Lowest satisfaction: IT department (2.92) & Wellness Program (1.73 rating)

**Project Delivery:**
- Average success rate: **78.36%** (21% of projects fall short of expectations)

---

### Summary
This analysis revealed critical gaps in real-time performance monitoring, training effectiveness, attendance accountability (especially at senior levels), and severe underutilization of employee benefits  particularly Paid Time-Off and Wellness Programs. Despite strong overall attendance and project delivery rates, low engagement scores, inconsistent training impact, and misaligned benefits spending are driving inefficiency, unnecessary costs, and hidden dissatisfaction (especially in high-performing IT teams).

---

### Recommendations
**Performance & Training:**
- Personalize training programs and make completion mandatory with better alignment to departmental needs.
- Introduce real-time performance dashboards and monthly location/department performance reports.
- Reward consistent high performers (>90% score) and conduct targeted reviews for underperforming units.

**Attendance & Accountability:**
- Digitize and monitor attendance in real-time with clear policies and leadership examples from seniors.

**Benefits Optimization:**
- Launch awareness campaigns to boost enrollment and usage of underutilized benefits (especially PTO).
- Re-evaluate Wellness Program provider due to extremely low satisfaction (1.73).
- Encourage PTO usage in high-performing but low-satisfaction departments like IT.

**Engagement & Retention:**
- Introduce tenure-based rewards (5- and 10-year milestones).
- Implement hybrid/flexible work models to increase satisfaction (proven higher among remote workers).
- Survey Finance (high satisfaction despite low performance) and IT (high performance, low satisfaction) to uncover specific drivers and pain points.
